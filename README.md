# web-game-complete

This is a hands-on workshop where you will develop, from scratch, a browser game "Guess a picture". In this game you can upload pictures with a secret phrase, and other players can guess the secret phrase based on the pictures uploaded.

You will learn how to implement a web app like a professional developer: write code, build automation to test and deploy the project, manage secrets and security concerns. You will get familiar with Python and HTML (for coding), GitHub, Docker, NoSQL (database technology), and Azure (cloud provider to host our application and its resources).

To get started, see the intro module [here](modules/00_intro/).
